clean - cleans out stale docker and git files and highlights large directories.
dmailhog - installs and starts mailhog.
dwhich - an improved which command that also highlights invalid paths
gitgc - runs garbage collection on all your git projects.
hog - finds system resource hogs.
ipaddr - shows the ip address on your local machine.
dmysql -  Connects you to a mysql cli pulling settings (username/password) from a local settings file.
